The prompt guides the user on how to interact with the SQL database, including proper syntax and constraints.

Structure
---------
- Imports: Necessary libraries and modules (if any).
- Function: A function to generate and return the SQL tool rules prompt template.
- Example Usage: An example of how to use the function to retrieve the prompt template.

Example usage:

    When using this tool, make sure to:
    - Use the correct SQL syntax. 
    - Always to put column and table names around `` since it's possible for them to have spaces or special characters.
    - Only query the tables that are available
    - Only query the columns that are available
    - Only query the values that are available
    - Before using the tool, if it's not clear what to query in the database, make any questions to make the tool usage more efficient.
    - By no means make DML statements (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, DROP etc.) to the database. Only SELECT statements are allowed.
    - Correct the user message if the values are not present in the database to what you assume it to be i.e. If the user asks for a ETFs, that's not a value of Asset Class column, but ETF is.
    - Only query what is available in the database, if the user asks for a value that is not present in the database, return an empty string.
